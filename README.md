# Amazon-Coding-Exercise-at-Internship-Experience-UK-2022
##Overview: 
Thank you for choosing to take part in Amazon's Coding Challenge for Bright Network. 
We are very happy to have you  here. 
We hope you have as much fun implementing this challenge as we had creating it! In this challenge, you are going to implement Amazon’s pathfinding algorithm for Amazon’s self-driving delivery vehicles.  The self-driving vehicle will need to create a path on a 2D-grid that contains a starting point (x,y), a delivery point (x,y) and a number of obstacles. Your vehicle can navigate to any of the adjacent squares (even diagonally), as long as the  squares are inbound and do not contain an obstacle.
